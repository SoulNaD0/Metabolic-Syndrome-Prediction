# Metabolic Syndrome Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the presence of metabolic syndrome using clinical and laboratory data. It uses machine learning models such as KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVC.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Metabolic_Syndrome_Prediction.ipynb` and run the cells.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Metabolic Syndrome.csv`.

## Results
The best-performing model was Random Forest with an accuracy of 84%.
